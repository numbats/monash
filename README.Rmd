<!-- badges: start -->

The `monash` R-package is a utility package with consolidated tools and templates for staffs at Monash University. The package contains three primary themes:

* **workflow**: automating repetitive tasks, particularly teaching related activities;
* **template**: Monash branded R Markdown templates for teaching, presentation, etc; and
* **data**: easy access to relevant information (may require access privileges).

## Installation

You can install `monash` R-package as below:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("numbats/monash")
```

## Get Monash logo

You can get a copy of the logo into the directory you wish with below.

```{r logo}
# default logo
monash::logo_get(path = "man/figures")
# black and white & one-line version of the logo
monash::logo_get(path = "man/figures", color = "black", stack = FALSE, filename = "monash-logo-black.png")
```

And then you can reference the logo file that you copied.

![](man/figures/monash-logo-black.png)


## Get Monash brand colors

These are handy commands to quickly see Monash brand colors and be able to copy-and-paste the hex color codes. 

```{r}
monash::color_show()
```


## Settings

(WIP) The monash package makes use of some values, listed below, from your R profile. 
You can modify this by using `usethis::edit_r_profile()` and adding below with 
values modified to your own values. 

```
options(monash.full_name = "Emi Tanaka",
        monash.email = "emi.tanaka@monash.edu",
        monash.orgunit = "Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics",
        monash.teaching_dir = "~/teaching/monash/",
        monash.workshop_dir = "~/workshop/")
```


## Teaching

(WIP) `create_teaching_directory("ETCXXXX")` would create a skeleton directory with folder and file structure below for development of teaching material. What is the advantage of this structure? It's designed to be synced with a private github repository and the materials in the `release` folder are *automatically* pushed using Github Repository to the public github repository for public release. The website associated with it will be also be built automatically as well. The website format will closely resemble [ETC5512: Wild-Caught Data](https://wcd.numbat.space/).

(WIP) `release_tutorial(1)` moves `tutorial-01.html` (and .Rmd) to the appropriate place in the `release` folder.

(WIP) Tutorial, slides and other templates for teaching.
