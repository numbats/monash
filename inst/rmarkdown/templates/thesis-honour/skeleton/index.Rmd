This file should be left empty other than the header above.

The thesis contents are contained in the other Rmd files: `01-chap1.Rmd `, `02-chap2.Rmd`, `A-appA.Rmd`, etc. Add new Rmd files as required. You'll need to edit the `_bookdown.yml` file to set the order in which you'd like them to appear.

If you have specific LaTeX packages to add, put them in `monashthesis.tex`.

You will need to ensure you have installed the `knitr` and `bookdown` packages for R.

You will also need LaTeX installed on your computer.
