Panopto videos, referred to as sessions, are composed of one or more streams, which may include video, powerpoint slides, screen capture, etc. You can add interactions to the session, such as quizzes and web links. This guide is mainly divided into three sections, **Add Panopto block**, **Working with Sessions** and **Working with Folders** and covers some general actions as shown below:

# Add Panopto Block

To use Panopto, you'll first need to add the Panopto block to your Moodle unit and provision your unit. This only needs to be done once per unit.

## Add the Panopto block

1. Navigate to the Moodle unit that you would like to use Panopto.
2. Ensure that editing is turned on.
3. Open the **Navigation Drawer** and scroll down and click the **Add a Block** button.

4. Select **Panopto** from the list to add the block. If you do not see Panopto on the list, the Panopto block may have already been added to your unit.

5. If your unit has already been provisioned by your Moodle administrator you will see an image similar to the one below. If not yet provisioned, follow the instructions below.

![](supp/panopto/panopto_instructions.png)
